        Jacob Peralta is my best detective. He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up." -Terry Jeffords
Peralta is a cop that has never been one to follow the rules too closely, frequently ignoring departmental guidelines and ignoring instructions from superior officers. Perhaps because he has the best arrest record among his colleagues, he's been enabled - if not indulged - throughout his entire career. That is, until the precinct gets a new commanding officer, Captain Raymond Holt, who reminds this hotshot cop to respect the badge.
