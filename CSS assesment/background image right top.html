    <h1>Pokemon</h1>
    <p>Pokémon[a] is a Japanese media franchise encompassing video games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, which are primarily caught and raised by Pokémon Trainers to battle each other for sport. The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12,[1] but it has garnered fans of all ages.[2][3][4][5]

        The concept behind the franchise was originated by Satoshi Tajiri. The first games in the franchise, Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green, were released for the Game Boy in Japan in February 1996. The games became sleeper hits, and were released internationally as Pokémon Red and Blue beginning in 1998. The international release of Red and Blue marked the beginning of an unprecedented global phenomenon that lasted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, known as "Pokémania". Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.

        The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by Game Freak, following an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on 27 February 1996, the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which the brand became a fixture in children's entertainment, with new products being released to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.
        
        Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure. While most IPs are owned by a single company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[6][7] Game Freak develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) subsidiary of TPC has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.[8]
