        Wikipedia uses various fonts, including Arial and Arial-based fonts, but there is no one font used in all of its skins.0 The default skin for Monobook and Vector is defined as font-family: sans-serif.3 The logo features an incomplete globe made of jigsaw pieces with glyphs from different writing systems inscribed on them, and the font used in its logotype and slogan text is Linux Libertine Capitals, which is an open source font created by the Libertine Open Fonts Project.2 The Wikipedia font is a basic, serif font designed by Philipp H. Poll and is licensed as Public Domain / GPL / OFL. It contains 2608 defined characters and 2166 unique glyphs.
