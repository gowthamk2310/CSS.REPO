    <h1>Upper case</h1>
    <P class="p1">Uppercase is primarily reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun, which makes lowercase the more common variant in regular text.3 Capitalization refers to writing a word with its first letter as a capital letter (uppercase letter) and the remaining letters in lower case, in writing systems with a case distinction.0 In English, capitalization is primarily needed for proper names, acronyms, and for the first letter of a sentence. Wikipedia avoids unnecessary capitalization and relies on sources to determine what is conventionally capitalized.1 All caps refers to text or font in which all letters are capital letters, commonly seen in legal documents and book covers</P>
    <h1>Lower case</h1>
    <p class="p2">Lowercase is an extreme form of ambient minimalism in which very quiet sounds are amplified to extreme levels. Minimal artist Steve Roden popularized the movement with an album entitled Forms of Paper, in which he made recordings of himself handling paper in various ways.
