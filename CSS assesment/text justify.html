        In wikitext, indentation refers to increasing a paragraph's left margin by adding a colon before the start of a paragraph.3 New paragraphs are not indented by default, but can be indented by starting them with :, ::, or ::: depending on the desired indentation.2 Most text does not require any special changes for wiki form, and indenting may cause the text to appear in a monospaced font.0 Indentation is most commonly used on talk pages and when there is a need for separating a block of text, such as inserting blocks of quoted and cited text.4 The indentation spacing generated by Template:Indent will match the alignment of a colon-shift : by using indent|5
        The template {{indent}} performs a newline and indents by a specified number of spaces. However, the spaces are not all the same size, but rather a mixture of en-size & em-size spaces that have been tested to work on a wide range of browsers. (To skip by n equal-size spaces, instead use {{in5|n}}, which puts all as the standard-size non-breaking space and does not force a newline.)

        Usage
        The indentation spacing generated by Template:Indent will match the alignment of a colon-shift : by using {{indent|5}}. To match ::, use {{indent|10}}.
        
        Note: This may vary depending on your browser.
        Usage: {{indent|# of spaces}}
        
        Indents up to 30 spaces. (use {{in5|n}} to skip up to 50 spaces)
        Indent differs from {{spaces}} only in that it automatically begins a wrapped-newline, then spaces over n spaces, whereas {{spaces}} spaces over n in the same (current) line.
