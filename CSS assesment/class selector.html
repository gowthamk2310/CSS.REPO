    <P class="c2">
        Pune Warriors India were a franchise Twenty20 cricket team that represented the city of Pune in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The team was one of two IPL franchises from the Indian state of Maharashtra, the other being Mumbai Indians. It was one of two new franchises added to the IPL for the 2011 season, alongside the also-defunct Kochi Tuskers Kerala. The team was owned by Sahara Group Sports Limited, a group company of the Indian business conglomerate Sahara India Pariwar.[2] The team's home ground was the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium[3][4] located in Gahunje, Pune.[5]
In May 2013, Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL over financial differences with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) stemming from the valuation of the league's annual franchise fee.[6] Their last match was on 19 May 2013 against Delhi Daredevils. The franchise was officially terminated by the BCCI five months later, in October 2013.[7]
The team was unsuccessful in their three years in the tournament, finishing second from last in their inaugural season and in their final season and last in 2012. Overall, the team played 46 matches, winning 12 and losing 33 with one match a no-result due to rain. The side's leading run scorer was Robin Uthappa[8] and its leading wicket-taker was Rahul Sharma.[9]
