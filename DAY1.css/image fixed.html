    <h1>Gradient</h1>
    <p>
        In vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function 
�
f of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) 
∇
�
\nabla f whose value at a point 
�
p is the "direction and rate of fastest increase". If the gradient of a function is non-zero at a point 
�
p, the direction of the gradient is the direction in which the function increases most quickly from 
�
p, and the magnitude of the gradient is the rate of increase in that direction, the greatest absolute directional derivative.[1] Further, a point where the gradient is the zero vector is known as a stationary point. The gradient thus plays a fundamental role in optimization theory, where it is used to maximize a function by gradient ascent. In coordinate-free terms, the gradient of a function 
�
(
�
)
f(\mathbf{r}) may be defined by:

�
�
=
∇
�
⋅
�
�
{\displaystyle df=\nabla f\cdot d\mathbf {r} }
where 
�
�
df is the total infinitesimal change in 
�
f for an infinitesimal displacement 
�
�
{\displaystyle d\mathbf {r} }, and is seen to be maximal when 
�
�
{\displaystyle d\mathbf {r} } is in the direction of the gradient 
∇
�
\nabla f. The nabla symbol 
∇\nabla , written as an upside-down triangle and pronounced "del", denotes the vector differential operator.

When a coordinate system is used in which the basis vectors are not functions of position, the gradient is given by the vector[a] whose components are the partial derivatives of 
�
f at 
�
p.[2] That is, for 
�
:
�
�
→
�
{\displaystyle f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} }, its gradient 
∇
�
:
�
�
→
�
�
{\displaystyle \nabla f\colon \mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}} is defined at the point 
�
=
(
�
1
,
…
,
�
�
)
{\displaystyle p=(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})} in n-dimensional space as the vector[b]

.
{\displaystyle \nabla f(p)={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}}(p)\\\vdots \\{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}}(p)\end{bmatrix}}.}
The gradient is dual to the total derivative 
�
�
df: the value of the gradient at a point is a tangent vector – a vector at each point; while the value of the derivative at a point is a cotangent vector – a linear functional on vectors.[c] They are related in that the dot product of the gradient of 
�
f at a point 
�
p with another tangent vector 
�
\mathbf {v}  equals the directional derivative of 
�
f at 
�
p of the function along 
�
\mathbf {v} ; that is, 
∇

{\textstyle \nabla f(p)\cdot \mathbf {v} ={\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {v} }}(p)=df_{p}(\mathbf {v} )}. The gradient admits multiple generalizations to more general functions on manifolds; see § Generalizations.
